# How the test harness works

![Test harness diagram](./img/harnessdataflow.png)

## Harness dataflow

The diagram above shows the components of the test harness and how data flows through them. The legend indicates the types of data that move between the components.

When a harness is created, a `reducer` and `rootSaga` are placed into the blocker and side-effect runner, respectively. From that point on, the harness can be used to run actions through the `reducer` and `rootSaga` in a similar fashion to Redux, while accumulating the transaction history in the form of blocks.

In general, the sequence of events in the formation of a block is:

1. The `actionPool` accumulates `actions` to be run through a `reducer` at some point in the future.
1. The `blocker` is called, takes all of the `actions` from the pool, and runs them sequentially.
1. The final reduced `state` is captured and packaged with the executed `actions` in the form of a `block`.
1. The `block` is sent to the state container where it is stored with the blocks that came before. The `state` from the `block` is unpacked and held as the current `state` of the harness.
1. The `block` is also sent to the side-effect runner, where each of the `actions` in the block is run individually through the `rootSaga`. They can be listened to using `take` effects. The `state` from the block can be grabbed with `select` effects. When an action is `put` from a saga, it goes into the `actionPool` to be executed in a future `block`.

## A note on `redispatches`

The harness also provides the `redispatch` function that can be imported with: 

```js
const { redispatch } = require('./test/harness')
```

This function takes a `state` and a list of `actions`, and returns a new state with the `actions` in a special reserved key. The `blocker` knows how to look at the reserved key and processes its contents immediately after the action that generated the key. Careless usage of this function can cause stack overflow errors.

This function should be used for one of the following purposes:

1. Sending actions to other covenants that run alongside this one.
1. Sending actions from this covenant's reducer to its saga. This allows the reducer to be used as an interface to the impure behaviour contained in the saga.
1. Decoupling a long reducer case into several smaller ones that are guaranteed to be run synchronously in one block creation call. This allows for behaviours inside a reducer to be broken down and re-used from several different reducer entry points.

## How to start a test harness

The test harness requires a covenant to start. Assuming you have a covenant of the form:

```js
const covenant = {
  reducer: (state, action) => { /* omitted */ return nextState },
  rootSaga: function* () { /* omitted */ }
}
```

The test harness can be started with the following code:

```js
const { createHarness } = require('./test/harness')
const harness = createHarness(covenant)
```

This returns an object with the interface described below.

## The harness interface

The test harness interface is:

```js
{
  dispatch:: Action -> (),
  waitForPool:: PoolPredicate -> Promise<Action>,
  block:: () -> (),
  subscribe:: Callback -> Unsubscribe,
  getState:: () -> Object,
  getBlocks:: () -> Array
}
```

Each of the methods are explained below.

### `dispatch`

Adds an action to the `actionPool`. Actions wait here until a block is created. A block is created using the `block` method.

### `waitForPool`

Returns a `Promise` that resolves when the `actionPool` is in a state specified by the `PoolPredicate`. The `PoolPredicate` can be any of the following types:

1. `undefined`: The `Promise` resolves the next time the pool gets an action added to it.
2. `string`: The `Promise` resolves the next time the pool gets an action with the type that matches the supplied string.
3. `number`: The `Promise` resolves the next time the pool size is equal to the supplied number.
4. `function`: A function with the signature `(Action, ActionPool) -> Boolean`. The `Promise` resolves whenever the function returns true. The current action being pooled is the first argument, and the rest of the pool is the second.

In all cases, the action that was being pooled when the predicate passes is what gets resolved in the `Promise`.

### `block`

Collects all the actions in the `actionPool` and informs the blocker to make a block with them. Making a block consists of running each action through the reducer with the current state, collecting the redispatched actions and running them, and producing a final state and a list of actions that were executed.

Blocks are formed even if there are no actions in the pool.

### `subscribe`

Runs the supplied callback function every time the state, managed by the harness, changes. That is, whenever a new block is made.

### `getState`

Returns the current state being managed by the harness.

### `getBlocks`

Returns the list of blocks that have accumulated by running the harness so far
